## Best Practices for Organic Promotion

1. **Build karma first** - Comment helpfully before posting
2. **Follow subreddit rules** - Each sub has different self-promo policies
3. **Be genuine** - Help people, don't just drop links
4. **Timing matters** - Post when US is awake (14:00-22:00 UTC)
5. **Engage with comments** - Reply to everyone on your posts

## Target Subreddits for Asklee

| Subreddit | Karma Req | Self-promo rules |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| r/SideProject | Low | Allowed, be helpful |
| r/selfhosted | Medium | Show technical depth |
| r/artificial | Medium | News/discussion focus |
| r/ChatGPT | Low | High volume, stand out |
| r/LocalLLaMA | Medium | Technical audience |
| r/startups | High | Provide value first |

## Rate Limits

- Posts: 1 per 10 minutes (new accounts stricter)
- Comments: ~1 per minute
- Votes: No strict limit but don't spam
- Wait 24h between posts to same subreddit

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Research what's being discussed
reddit browse r/SideProject --sort new --limit 50

# Find relevant posts to engage with
reddit search "AI assistant" --subreddit SideProject

# Comment helpfully on a few posts first
reddit comment abc123 "Have you tried using webhooks for this? Here's how I solved it..."

# After building presence, share your project
reddit post r/SideProject --title "Show r/SideProject: Asklee - Deploy an AI assistant to WhatsApp in 60 seconds" --text "Hey everyone! I built this because..."

# Engage with all responses
reddit inbox --unread
```
